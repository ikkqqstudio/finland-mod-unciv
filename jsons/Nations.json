		"startIntroPart1": "The Eruch Empire began as a series of impassioned debates between long established noble families about the growing chaos in the world and what could be done to stop it. The debates soon reached a critical mass for action, fueled by the noblesâ€™ fear of an uncertain future as well as their desire to protect their wealth. A secret council was formed, drawing on the leadership and military prowess that had been their inheritance from previous generations. It mobilized a small but well-equipped army. With it, the nobles carved out a large territory that would become the core of Eruch, and seceded from the old kingdoms.",
